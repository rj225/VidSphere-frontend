solution: just remove the empty fragments (<> </>).

          videos.map((video, index) => (
            <Link key={`${video._id}_${index}`} to={`/videoplayer/${video._id}`}>
            <div
              className="p-4 cursor-pointer"

<video controls width="60%" height="auto">
  <source src={videoFile} type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

error context:"the video was not getting played"

solution: " check Conditionally if the "videoFile" is not null. before it was playing the videoFile in null state. even useeffect was used to update the videoFile link, without checking condtionally it was unable to run"

solved:
  {videoFile && ( // Conditionally render if videoFile is not null
      <video controls width="60%" height="auto">
        <source src={videoFile} type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
    )}

error context : current user like not getting fetched on initial reload.
tried1 : useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
    fetchVideo();
    fetchLikedVideos();
  }, [likeClicked , dislikeClicked , likes]); 

tried2 : useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
    fetchVideo();
    fetchLikedVideos();
  }, []);

solution: still not very clear. But as far as i got, i called the fetchLikedVideos() inside the fetchvideo() as video was getting fetched on initial reload.
solved:
const fetchVideo = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(
        `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/video/${id}`
      );
     
      setLikes(response.data.data.likes);
      await fetchLikedVideos();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }
  };
